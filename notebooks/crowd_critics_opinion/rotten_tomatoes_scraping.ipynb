When at least 60% of reviews for a movie or show are positive, a red tomato is displayed to indicate its fresh status. Otherwise a green splat is displayed to indicate its rotten status. When the title hasn't been released or there are not enough ratings to generate a score, no tomatometer score is available. In the generated dataframe the tomatometer score is given as `tMeterScore`. An average rating over 10 is also available alongside `tMeterScore`. This can be obtained by running the function `getScores` for each link. It is expected that `tMeterScore` correlates with this average rating, therefore there may be no need to make the average rating available in the
