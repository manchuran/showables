# Project Summary
This repository contains a `.rmd` file with details on the prediction of breast cancer recurrence using
a handful of classification methods.

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the world. Thanks to available machine
learning techniques, we are able to take a shot at predicting its recurrence in women. In this `.rmd` file,
we examine four different classification methods for carrying out this task: decision tree and naive-bayes, 
logistic regression and artificial neural networks.


## Step 1
Download folder `breast-cancer-data`.

## Step 2
Open `.rmd` file in RStudio, and run chunks.
If RStudio unavailable, open `.html` file to assess results of project.
